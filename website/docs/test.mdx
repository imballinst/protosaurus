### Booking

</DefinitionHeader>

Represents the booking of a vehicle.

Vehicles are some cool shit. But drive carefully.

```protosaurus--booking.v1.Booking
message Booking {
  // ID of booked vehicle.
  int32 vehicle_id = 1;

  // Customer that booked the vehicle. [^1]
  // highlight-next-line
  int32 customer_id = 2; // [^2]
}
```

Pretty sure we can still annotation outside of the codeblock[^3], right?

[^1]: this is a sample annotation. I can also put `code` hree!
[^2]: this is another sample annotation.
[^3]: it works!
